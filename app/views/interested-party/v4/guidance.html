        Any previous comments that you submitted as part of an application will be considered by the Planning Inspector. The local planning department shares these with the Planning Inspectorate, so there is no need to submit repeat comments.

        You should avoid including sensitive information (also called special category information) if it's not relevant to the appeal. Any sensitive information you share may be shared publicly if the Planning Inspector agrees that it's relevant to your appeal.

      <p>
        Your comments must not include inflammatory or abusive language.

        If you include any personal information that's not relevant, we'll ask you to resubmit. This could mean that you miss the deadline to submit comments.
