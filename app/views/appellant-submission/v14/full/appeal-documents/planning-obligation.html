              A planning obligation is when you agree to do something if your development goes ahead. This is usually to help manage your development's impact on the surrounding area.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              For example, you might agree to:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>
                donate to a wildlife charity, if your development will affect local wildlife
              </li>
              <li>
                help fund improvements to nearby roads, if your development will increase traffic
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              A planning obligation is a legal document. When the agreement is between you and the local planning department, it's called a 'section 106 agreement'. When the agreement is between you and another party, it's called a 'unilateral undertaking'.
