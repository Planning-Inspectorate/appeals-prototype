    <p>Upload an appeal statement (also known as a 'grounds for appeal') that explains why you think the Local Planning Authority's decision was incorrect.​</p>
    <p>It should respond to the LPA's reasons for refusal (these can be found on the decision letter), and include any other information that supports your appeal.</p>
    <p>If you refer to any documents in your appeal statement, for example photographs, you can upload them in the next step.​</p>

          How to write your appeal statement
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p>When you appeal, the Planning Inspectorate looks at whether the Local Planning Authority (LPA) correctly applied the relevant planning policies to your original planning application.</p>
        <p>You should set out why you think the LPA’s decision was incorrect in an appeal statement (also called a ‘grounds of appeal’). It should respond to the LPA's reasons for refusal, which can be found on the LPA's decision notice.</p>
        <p>If you think there is other relevant information that supports your appeal, this is the opportunity to highlight it to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Reasons for refusal</h4>
        <p>The first step is to read the LPA’s decision notice, where they list their reasons for refusing the planning application. Each reason for refusal will mention the planning policy the LPA based their decision on. If you think the LPA’s reason for refusal is incorrect, list your evidence in your statement.</p>
        <p><strong>For example:</strong> the LPA refused your application on the grounds of the proposal’s detrimental effect on the neighbours, but you have checked the relevant planning policy and do not think this is correct according to your measurements.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Details of other relevant applications/appeals</h4>
        <p>If there are other appeals being considered for the same site, or similar proposals or appeals for sites in the local area, and they support your appeal, you should list them in your grounds of appeal. If possible, identify them on a street map with their addresses.</p>
        <p><strong>For example:</strong> your neighbour appealed a refusal for a similar proposal and was successful.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Supporting documents</h4>
        <p>You will be able to upload any documents that you think support your appeal – this could be photographs of the site in relation to its neighbours, for example. If you plan to upload any supporting documents, you should refer to them in your appeal statement and explain why they are relevant.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Responding to comments from interested parties</h4>
        <p>There may have been comments (also called ‘representations’) from interested parties on the original planning application. If you think these unreasonably influenced the LPA to refuse your planning application, refer to them here and explain why you do not think they are relevant.</p>
        <p><strong>For example:</strong> interested parties commented on the planning application that the proposal would affect the character of the local area, but other nearby properties have had similar proposals approved.</p>
